# gpuHAVOK
This is a testbed for system identification and forecasting of dynamical systems using the Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (HAVOK) algorithm. This code is based on work by Brunton &amp; Kutz (2022) "Data-Driven Science and Engineering", and my aim is to improve the efficiency of the algorithm through GPU/CPU optimization.
